    </string>

    <string name="cbc_description">

    </string>

    <string name="inr_description">
        (Standardized Prothrombin time)  This blood test is calculated using a prothrombin time test and is used to regulate how fast your blood is clotting.  A person taking blood thinners will be monitoring their INR test on a regular basis to make sure it is within the range your physician thinks is therapeutic for your condition.

    </string>

    <string name="lipase_description">

    <string name="d_dimer_description">
        (Fibrin Degradation Fragment)  This blood test is used to rule out a blood clot.  When a blood clot forms in your body, the clot releases a substance called D-Dimer into the blood stream.   If your healthcare provider suspects you have a blood clot such as a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) or a PE (pulmonary embolism), it’s likely they will perform this test before more advanced tests.  Symptoms of a blood clot include leg swelling, arm swelling, shortness of breath or a faster than normal heart beat

    <string name="troponin_description">
        (Cardiac Troponin)  This blood test checks to see if you’ve had damage to your heart or are having a heart attack.  A decrease of oxygen to your heart can cause your heart to release an enzyme called troponin.  A healthcare provider may perform this test if you’ve had an chest pain, an abnormal EKG, chronic or acute heart failure or an infection in your heart muscle.
    </string>

    <string name="amylase_description">
        This blood test is used to diagnose or manage pancreatitis, appendicitis, eating disorders or infections.

During this procedure, the technician will apply stickers to the patients chest, arms and legs.  The EKG machine is connected to these stickers and a picture of the electrical activity of the heart is taken.  This picture will be evaluated by the physician for heart enlargement, decreased oxygen flow to the heart, infections in the heart as well as imbalances in electrolytes such as potassium, magnesium and calcium.

        These test are commonly done in the emergency department or in the doctors office as part of a general health exam.
    </string>

    <string name="iv_placement_description">
        (intravenous catheter)  This procedure is performed by the nurse, medical assistant or physician by putting a small catheter in the vein of your arm.

    </string>

    <string name="iv_therapy_description">
        (intravenous therapy/hydration)  This therapy is often referred to as an “IV drip”.  During this process,  liquid is infused into the vein through an IV catheter.  This therapy can be used to correct electrolyte imbalances, rehydrate, give medications, or transfuse blood.
